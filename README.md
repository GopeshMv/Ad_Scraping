# Ad_Scraping
Here we have accomplished ad scraping from google search page , where we will extract the details of the ad that is present and is displayed in the website.
It is generalised to scrape all the elements that is under the common division that google has placed the ads in.
The format of ads is different in different websites and I have taken google search site here, in certain sites we need to access the js part where the ads have been added on which are trigged by certain events. In such case it is required to use Selenium for robot automation for triggering events, in order to mimic and scrape the ads.
